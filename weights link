weights link to download the file: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam316/yolov3-weights/data?select=yolov3.weights
 
because while pushing the code into git repo i'm facing a problem like git file size is exced 100MB . 
because of this i'm giving this link to provide the weights file location where you can able to download 
the files freely and able to run the code correctly without facing any issues.
